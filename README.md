# 2048 Game

This is my entry in the Programmer's Day competition in 2023, where a 2048 game was requested. I have programmed it in Python.
And won in second place.


## Overview

The 2048 game is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective is to combine tiles with the same number until you reach the tile with the number 2048.


## Features

- **Simple Gameplay**: Easy to learn, challenging to master.
- **Python Implementation**: Built using Python, showcasing programming skills and game logic.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface to enhance the gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.
2. Tiles with the same number will merge into one when they touch.
3. Continue combining tiles until you reach the 2048 tile or cannot make any more moves.

## Installation

To run the game, ensure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and run the main script:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 2048-game
python main.py
